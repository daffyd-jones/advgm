# Adventure Game

Curently runs in terminal

Not completely finished. The plot and description needs to be filled out and more
encounters need to be added. The world is able to be navigated mostly, some parts
connect weirdly because there is supposed to be a part between them that is not made.

Once this version of the game is made the goal is to expand it into having a GUI
using pygame instead of the terminal.
